This was just too good to leave rotting on my hard drive.

This is a Block 'n' Load map viewer which I intend to turn into an editor.

This will serve as the basis for the game I want to eventually make that has no name and unfortunately not much of a game either. Once I've gutted out most of the textures, that is. I'm saving that brick texture though. Gotta have that brick texture. It's glorious. You'll know it when you see it. Which you'll probably end up doing when you get bored and dig through the data files.

No maps are provided as at the moment the only maps are (C) Jagex and thus I cannot include them. However, if you want them, prod me. *Do not steal them for your game.* (But if you want to join the Map Editor Alliance, a thing I just made up now, then go ahead!)

Currently the raytracer has a beamtraced depth-only pass. This doesn't improve performance as much as I would have liked it to. But it does keep the scene above 60fps most of the time, at least when shadows are disabled, so it stays.

Also, if I can get the shadows traced at a lower-res pass at a nice speed, then I will have at least achieved the "I made this perform better than the real thing by doing it the Slow Way(TM)" award.
