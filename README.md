WIP raytracer for demosplash 2015
"The Future Is Yesterday"

by GreaseMonkey

dependencies: SDL2, libepoxy, Lua 5.3

uses datenwolf's linmath.h "licensed" under WTFPLv2 (Public Domain)

my compile + run flags:

    make && ./tfiy

run from this directory or else it will choke, this is NOT the time to do stupid getcwd hacks this early in development

licence TBD, probably will be GPL
